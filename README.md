# Spyfall
Command line version of the app 'Spyfall'

There is a mobile app game called 'Spyfall'.
I am in no way claiming responsibility for the invention of this game, only this short source code.

This was designed so that I could pass a laptop around the room and have people play the game, instead of
relying on people having the app on their phone. Many of my friends don't have smartphones, so in order
to play the game, I wrote a command line version that we could play instead.

I may make a GUI for it one day, but for now, it did the job and gave us an afternoon of fun.
